# LinkedIn Post - WordPress on AWS with Terraform

---

🚀 **Just deployed a production-ready WordPress site on AWS using Infrastructure as Code!** 

I'm excited to share my latest project where I built a scalable WordPress infrastructure using Terraform, demonstrating modern DevOps practices and cloud-native architecture.

## 🏗️ **What I Built:**
✅ **Secure VPC Architecture** - Isolated network with public/private subnets  
✅ **WordPress on EC2** - Auto-configured with Apache, PHP, and WordPress  
✅ **MySQL RDS Database** - Managed database in private subnets for security  
✅ **Multi-AZ Deployment** - High availability across availability zones  
✅ **Modular Terraform Code** - Reusable modules for networking, database, and compute  
✅ **Environment Management** - Separate dev/test configurations  

## 🔧 **Key Technologies:**
• **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code  
• **AWS VPC** - Network isolation and security  
• **EC2** - Compute instances for WordPress  
• **RDS MySQL** - Managed database service  
• **Security Groups** - Network-level security  
• **Multi-AZ** - High availability design  

## 💡 **Why This Matters:**
In today's cloud-first world, being able to provision infrastructure programmatically is crucial. This project demonstrates:

🎯 **Infrastructure as Code** - Version-controlled, repeatable deployments  
🎯 **Security Best Practices** - Database isolation, proper network segmentation  
🎯 **Scalability** - Foundation for horizontal scaling and load balancing  
🎯 **Cost Optimization** - Right-sized resources for different environments  

## 📊 **Architecture Highlights:**
The solution uses a **3-tier architecture**:
• **Presentation Tier**: WordPress on EC2 in public subnets
• **Application Tier**: PHP processing on the same EC2 instances  
• **Data Tier**: MySQL RDS in private subnets for security

## 🛠️ **DevOps Practices Implemented:**
• **Modular Design** - Separate modules for networking, database, and compute
• **Environment Separation** - Different configurations for dev/test
• **Automated Provisioning** - One-command deployment
• **Security by Design** - Least-privilege access and network isolation

## 🎓 **Key Learnings:**
1. **Module Dependencies** - Proper resource referencing between Terraform modules
2. **Security Groups** - Balancing accessibility with security
3. **RDS Best Practices** - Subnet groups and parameter configurations
4. **EC2 Provisioning** - Automated software installation and configuration

## 🔗 **Check it out:**
The complete code is available on my GitHub with detailed documentation, architecture diagrams, and step-by-step deployment instructions.

## 🤔 **What's Next:**
Planning to extend this with:
• Application Load Balancer for high availability
• Auto Scaling Groups for dynamic scaling  
• CloudFront CDN for global performance
• CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
• Monitoring with CloudWatch and alerts
